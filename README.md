Attack on PharmaHelp

## Overview
This is for a project that examines security and defenses for an agentic system. We want to identify attack surfaces and vectors - we will collect metrics. There will be a target application (PharmaHelp), as well as an attack service (BioBreak). BioBreak that will attempt to attack PharmaHelp.

A fictitious biotech company BioForge needs an application to help with managing research documents. The proposed app PharmaHelp will allow users to browse internal documents as well as public databases (Pubmed). This repository will be implemented as a RAG. The app allows -

User can upload research documents
User can make natural language queries
The app will generate a synthesis summary document. The synthesis, along with supporting documents will be made available to the user.
This project is about finding out how badly an agentic AI system can be manipulated through its own data sources. We attack it from three angles — the RAG pipeline, the agentic reasoning loops, and the MCP layer, and measure how far the damage goes.
